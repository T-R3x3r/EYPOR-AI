# Model Selection System Implementation

## üéØ Overview

I have implemented a comprehensive model selection system that automatically detects database changes and asks the user which model to rerun, with special highlighting for "runall" files.

## üîß Key Components Implemented

### 1. **Frontend Components**
- **ModelRerunDialogComponent**: Modal dialog for user interaction
  - `frontend/src/app/components/model-rerun-dialog/model-rerun-dialog.component.ts`
  - `frontend/src/app/components/model-rerun-dialog/model-rerun-dialog.component.html`
  - `frontend/src/app/components/model-rerun-dialog/model-rerun-dialog.component.css`

### 2. **Database Tracking Service**
- **DatabaseTrackingService**: Tracks database changes and manages rerun requests
  - `frontend/src/app/services/database-tracking.service.ts`
  - Detects database modifications
  - Discovers available models via API
  - Manages model selection workflow

### 3. **Backend Endpoints**
- **Model Discovery**: `/discover-models` - Finds available model files
- **Model Execution**: `/execute-model` - Executes selected model files
- **Enhanced Action Chat**: Updated `/action-chat` to use LangGraph agent properly

### 4. **LangGraph Agent Enhancements**
- **Action Type Tracking**: Properly tracks action types for frontend
- **Database Modification Detection**: Detects when database parameters are changed
- **File Creation and Execution**: Actually creates and executes files (fixed the lying issue)

## üöÄ How It Works

### Step 1: Database Change Detection
When a user makes a database modification request:
1. The LangGraph agent processes the request
2. If it's a `DATABASE_MODIFICATION`, it updates database parameters
3. The frontend detects `db_modification_detected` flag in the response
4. This triggers the DatabaseTrackingService to initiate model selection

### Step 2: Model Discovery
The system automatically discovers available models:
1. Searches for Python files with patterns like `runall`, `model`, `main`, etc.
2. Prioritizes `runall` files and displays them first
3. Shows all available models in a user-friendly dialog

### Step 3: User Selection
The user can:
1. **Select specific models**: Choose individual files by number
2. **Run all models**: Select "all" to execute everything
3. **Skip models**: Choose not to run any models
4. **Provide feedback**: Give specific instructions for model execution

### Step 4: Model Execution
After user selection:
1. Selected models are executed in sequence
2. Results are captured and displayed
3. Any errors are handled gracefully
4. Database state is preserved throughout

## üé® UI/UX Features

### Visual Design
- **Consistent Yellow Branding**: Uses #FFE600 throughout
- **Animated Highlights**: Runall files have pulsing yellow borders
- **Professional Layout**: Clean, modern dialog design
- **Responsive Grid**: Model cards adapt to screen size

### User Experience
- **Always Ask**: Never runs models automatically - always requires confirmation
- **Clear Recommendations**: Explicitly highlights runall files
- **Multiple Actions**: User can approve, reject, or cancel
- **Progress Feedback**: Shows execution status and results

## üîç Fixed Issues

### 1. **File Creation Issue** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Agent was claiming to create files but not actually doing so
- **Solution**: Updated action-chat endpoint to properly use LangGraph agent and track created files

### 2. **Execution Output Issue** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: No output was showing in execution window
- **Solution**: Properly track `last_execution_output` and `last_execution_error` in agent

### 3. **Database Wiping Issue** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Database was being wiped instead of preserving changes
- **Solution**: Enhanced database tracking to preserve state and highlight changes

### 4. **Human-in-the-Loop Trigger** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Dialog wasn't appearing after database changes
- **Solution**: Added `db_modification_detected` flag and proper trigger logic

## üìù Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Database Parameter Change
```
User: "Update the price parameter to 15.99"
Expected: Dialog appears with runall files highlighted
```

### Scenario 2: Visualization Request
```
User: "Create a bar chart for the output"
Expected: Files are actually created and shown in sidebar
```

### Scenario 3: Database Modification
```
User: "Modify the inventory table to increase quantity by 10"  
Expected: Dialog appears asking which model to rerun
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Changes
```python
# Enhanced action-chat endpoint
@app.post("/action-chat")
async def action_chat(request: ActionRequest):
    # Uses LangGraph agent properly
    response, created_files = agent.run(...)
    # Tracks files and execution output
    # Detects database modifications
```

### Frontend Integration
```typescript
// Database modification detection
if (response.db_modification_detected) {
    this.databaseTracking.parseModificationResponse(response.response);
}
```

### Model Discovery
```python
# Discovers models with priority for runall files
runall_files = [f for f in model_files if 'runall' in f.lower()]
other_files = [f for f in model_files if 'runall' not in f.lower()]
sorted_files = runall_files + other_files
```

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. **Automatic Model Discovery**
- Searches project directory for model files
- Identifies common model file patterns
- Prioritizes `runall` files for user convenience

### 2. **User Control**
- Always asks before running models
- Allows selective model execution
- Provides clear model descriptions
- Supports batch operations

### 3. **Runall File Highlighting**
- Automatically detects `runall` files
- Displays them prominently in the dialog
- Recommends them as primary options
- Maintains user choice flexibility

### 4. **Database State Preservation**
- Maintains database integrity during model execution
- Preserves parameter changes
- Tracks modification history
- Provides rollback capabilities

## üß™ Testing and Validation

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Basic Model Selection
```
User: "Update the price parameter to 15.99"
Expected: Database updated ‚Üí Dialog appears with runall files highlighted
```

#### Scenario 2: Multiple Model Execution
```
User: "Change maximum capacity to 5000"
Expected: Database updated ‚Üí User selects multiple models ‚Üí All execute successfully
```

#### Scenario 3: No Models Available
```
User: "Modify the inventory table"
Expected: Database updated ‚Üí No models found ‚Üí Clean completion
```

#### Scenario 4: Model Execution Errors
```
User: "Update parameters and run models"
Expected: Database updated ‚Üí Model selection ‚Üí Error handling for failed models
```

## üéØ Key Benefits

1. **User Control**: Always asks before running models
2. **Smart Discovery**: Automatically finds relevant model files
3. **Runall Priority**: Highlights and recommends runall files
4. **Database Preservation**: Maintains database state with change highlighting
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of model execution failures
6. **Flexible Selection**: Supports individual, multiple, or no model execution

## üéØ Conclusion

The system now provides a complete model selection workflow that ensures user control over model reruns while maintaining database integrity and actually executing the requested operations.
